tutorial repository for github intro

In the past I've always had my own private code repositories either in google drive or on my laptop... I know... BAD.

This is my attempt at getting familiar with github so I can be more effective at collaborating with others on development projects down the road... either as distributing to a group or as a member of a dev team.  Woo hoo!
